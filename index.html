      </b> we introduce <b>CarFormer</b>, an auto-regressive transformer model that can both drive and act as a world
      model, predicting future states. We show that a learned, self-supervised, object-centric representation for
      self-driving based on slot attention
      contains the information necessary for driving such as speed and orientation of vehicles.</div>

    <h1>Abstract</h1>
    <p style="width: 80%;">
      The choice of representation plays a key role in self-driving. Bird’s eye view (BEV) representations have shown
      remarkable performance in recent years.
      In this paper, we propose to learn object-centric representations in BEV to distill a complex scene into more
      actionable information for self-driving.
      We first learn to place objects into slots with a slot attention model on BEV sequences.
      Based on these object-centric representations, we then train a transformer to learn to drive as well as reason
      about the future of other vehicles.
      We found that object-centric slot representations outperform both scene-level and object-level approaches that use
      the exact attributes of objects.
      Slot representations naturally incorporate information about objects from their spatial and temporal context such
      as position, heading, and speed without explicitly providing it.
      Our model with slots achieves an increased completion rate of the provided routes and, consequently, a higher
      driving score, with a lower variance across multiple runs, affirming slots as a reliable alternaive
      in object-centric approaches. Additionally, we validate our model’s performance as a world model through
      forecasting experiments, demonstrating its capability to accurately predict future slot representations.

      CarFormer, using self-supervised

      <b>Quantitative Results on forecasting</b> These results show the ability of CarFormer to predict the future BEV
      representation at T=t+1 and T=t+4.
      CarFormer outperforms the simple copy baseline.
